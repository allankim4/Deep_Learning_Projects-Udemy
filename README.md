## Section 4 Project
### Artificail Neural Network
The model is created using keras with tensorflow-gpu on backend. With a complete model, it gave an accuracy hovering aroung 81-86% accuracy.

The model improvement was done using K-fold with 10 folds. However, since this model was utilizing 1 GPU, there is no parallel processing. Hence, despite it is GPU accelerated computing, the model can utilize the parallel processes.
