## Section 4 Project
### Artificail Neural Network
The model is created using keras with tensorflow-gpu on backend. With a complete model, it gave an accuracy hovering aroung 81-86% accuracy.

The model improvement was done using K-fold with 10 folds. However, since this model was utilizing 1 GPU, there is no parallel processing. Hence, despite it is GPU accelerated computing, the model can utilize the parallel processes. 

New GPU was used but only improved the processing time per epoch (shaved of about 1-2 seconds per epoch; from gtx 1080 to gtx 1080 ti)

## Section 10
### Convolutional Neural Network
The model was initiated similarly to a common neural network.

2 layers of convolutional network was created without padding.
